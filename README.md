This is my first React application made as one of my exam projects for JavaScript developers postgraduate studies.
In a few words: it's a very simple online store that lists API products. You can: filter products on the catalog page, add them to the cart, check and edit the contents of the cart.

I used: ReactJS, Create React App, React Router, fetching from API, React Redux, Styled Components, PropTypes, Atomic Design and some FontAwesome icons as svgs.

To deploy on your machine clone this repo, run npm install command and npm start afterwards. Enjoy ! :)

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.
